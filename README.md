# DevOps Seminar Demo ‚Äì HCMUS

Welcome to the **DevOps Demo Project** used in the seminar at **Ho Chi Minh City University of Science (HCMUS)**.  
This repository showcases a basic DevOps workflow including CI/CD with Jenkins, infrastructure as code with Terraform, containerization with Docker, and a modern web application.

## üìÅ Project Structure

This repository is divided into two main parts:

- **`infrastructure/`**: Contains all Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) configuration using Terraform. It includes provider setup, reusable modules, environment variables, and Terraform state management for deploying cloud infrastructure.

- **`source_code/`**: Contains the application code, built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Prisma. It includes Docker configuration for local development and deployment, along with supporting libraries and database setup.

Each part includes its own `README.md` for more specific instructions:

- [Infrastructure README](infrastructure/README.md)
- [Source Code README](source_code/README.md)

## üöÄ Tech Stack

- **CI/CD**: Jenkins
- **IaC**: Terraform
- **Infrastucture**: AWS ECS
- **Containerization**: Docker, ECS
- **Frontend/Backend**: Next.js (TypeScript)
- **Database ORM**: Prisma
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

## üìö Seminar Goal
This demo was created to give students a hands-on look at:

- Structuring a full DevOps project

- Using Jenkins for CI/CD pipelines

- Managing infrastructure with Terraform

- Running modern apps in Docker

- Connecting development with production workflows
